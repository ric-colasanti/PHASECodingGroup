                    <p>Golang, also known as Go, is a statically typed, compiled, high-level programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C,but much friendlier</p>

                    <p>Go is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, but mainly because it makes searching much easer.</p>
                        
                    <p>Go is a relatively new language, having been released in 2009. However, it has quickly become popular due to its simplicity, efficiency, and concurrency capabilities. Go is used by a wide range of companies, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>
                        
                    <p>Here are some of the features of Go:</p>
                        
                    <p>Simplicity. Go is a simple language with a small number of keywords. This makes it easy to learn and read.</p>
                        <p>Efficiency. Go is a compiled language, which means that it is converted into machine code before it is executed. This makes Go programs faster than interpreted languages like Python.</p>
                        <p>Concurrency. Go has built-in support for concurrency, which makes it easy to write programs that can run multiple tasks at the same time.
                        <p>It is super easy to create compiled programs for Windows Mac and Linux</p>

                    <p> Google's Colab a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources.This means that the model can be run by anyone with a Google account and a Chrome or Edge browser. Nothing needs to be installed on their computer. </p>
